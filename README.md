One of the most suggested ways to establish a business in India is to form a private limited company. With specific constraints on ownership, this sort of organisation provides limited responsibility for its stockholders. An LLP is run by partners who own and control the company. In the case of a private limited business, directors may be distinct from shareholders.

Benefits of Company Registration
There are several advantages to forming a corporation. A registered corporation adds legitimacy to your firm. It benefits your company by:
•	Personal responsibility is protected, as are other risks and damages.
•	Increase your consumer base.
•	Acquire bank credits and decent investments from trustworthy entrepreneurs with convenience.
•	Provides liability protection to safeguard your company's assets.
•	Increased capital contribution and reliability
•	Increases the possibility for large-scale growth and expansion.

Checklist for Company Registration in India
We must ensure that the checklist criteria are completed, as outlined by the Companies Act 2013.

Two Directors: A private limited corporation must have a minimum of two directors and a maximum of fifteen. At least one of the company's directors must be an Indian national.

Spectacular Name: Your company's name should be one-of-a-kind. The proposed name should not be similar to any existing companies or trademarks in India.

Minimum Capital Contribution: There is no such thing as a minimum capital contribution for a corporation. A firm must have at least one lakh in authorised capital.

Registered Office: A company's registered office does not have to be a commercial facility. A rental property can also serve as the registered office if a letter of authorization from the landlord is acquired.

What are the name criteria for a Company Registration?
In India, the registrar of companies (RoC) expects applicants to fulfil a few name requirements. Some of them are subjective, which implies that acceptance may be contingent on the officer handling your application's judgement. However, the more strictly you follow the guidelines outlined below, the more likely you are to be approved. But before that, ensure that your identity is widely obtainable.
